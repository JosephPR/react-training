While on my journey to discover the magic of react I have build an ever growing application that post all data to a rails backend. Mostly css except for a button from material-ui. The app consists of an array of components, there is also a real time clock that will update according to the time zone you are in. There is a pet information page that has data sore in rails about dogs, cats and exotic pets.

 The next component consumes a marketdata api that is holding 20 stocks with intraday updating information, 52 week high and lows, closing price the previous day and intraday price.

 There is a Robot rolodex that consumes a json dummy data api, fetches robots as well then combines the two with nifty little cards for each robot and a search bar to filter all of your robots.

 Pokèmon api collects pokèmon allows you to post  what your favorite pokèmon is and a button to increment a count.

 Chuck norris api component that display's 6 random Chuck Norris jokes

Nested route page that contains information  about particular topics that pertain to programming.

Coding Challenge from Flatiron School for the last mode of the Software Program.


Rick and Morty page that displays random caracters.

This app will continue to grow as I continue to learn react.




## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
